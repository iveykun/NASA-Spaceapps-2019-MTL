Build a planet

The goal is to help interested children and students learn more about space exploration, terraforming and extraterrestial life.

The program takes certain inputs and will automatically generate possible values for the rest of the parameters. It will also display a habitable range so you know when you are building a planet that will be able to host life.

to run, start the html file and host the python file on your server. You have to rename it to app.py

change the server in custom.js
if it still doesn't work install moesif CORS for disabled protection

to get a value, focus the mouse on the value you want to get, then press "see change"
